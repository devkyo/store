## Project Overview

**Shadcn-UI Store** is a **Frontend-only** virtual store project built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Shadcn-UI**, **Zustand**, and **TailwindCSS**. This project features a shopping cart where users can add products, view the total, and at the end of the checkout process, the application generates a summary message containing all customer details and selected products. This message is sent to the store via **WhatsApp**.

This project is purely client-side, meaning there is **no backend** or **API integration** involved. It serves as an example of modern UI development with interactive components, state management, and dynamic content rendering.

## Features

-   Interactive shopping cart functionality.
-   Automatic generation of a WhatsApp message with the order summary.
-   Fully responsive design with TailwindCSS.
-   Modular and reusable components using Shadcn-UI.
-   State management handled by Zustand.
